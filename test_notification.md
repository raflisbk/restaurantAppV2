# Notification System Implementation Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Replaced Timer-based daily reminders with zonedSchedule

**Before (Timer-based - only works in foreground):**
```dart
_dailyReminderTimer = Timer(delay, () async {
  // Show notification
  await showNotification(...);
  _scheduleNextDayReminder();
});
```

**After (zonedSchedule-based - works even when app is closed):**
```dart
await flutterLocalNotificationsPlugin.zonedSchedule(
  0, // notification id
  'Waktunya Makan Siang! üçΩÔ∏è',
  'Jangan lupa cek rekomendasi restoran hari ini!',
  scheduledDate,
  NotificationDetails(...),
  androidScheduleMode: AndroidScheduleMode.exactAllowWhileIdle,
  matchDateTimeComponents: DateTimeComponents.time, // Daily repeat
);
```

### 2. Key Improvements

- **Persistent Scheduling**: Notifications now work even when app is closed
- **Daily Repeat**: Uses `DateTimeComponents.time` for automatic daily repetition
- **Battery Optimization**: Uses `AndroidScheduleMode.exactAllowWhileIdle` for reliable delivery
- **Timezone Aware**: Uses proper timezone handling with `tz.TZDateTime`
- **Proper Cleanup**: Improved cancellation logic

### 3. Test Functions Updated

- `scheduleTestNotification()`: Now uses zonedSchedule instead of Timer
- `getPendingNotifications()`: Added to debug scheduled notifications
- Both immediate and scheduled test notifications available

### 4. Settings Integration

The settings screen will continue to work as before, but now with proper scheduled notifications that persist across app restarts.

## Testing Instructions

1. Enable daily reminder in Settings
2. Set a custom time
3. Close the app completely
4. Wait for the scheduled time
5. Notification should appear even with app closed

## Technical Details

- Uses `flutter_local_notifications` zonedSchedule API
- Properly handles Android exact alarms with `exactAllowWhileIdle`
- Maintains timezone awareness for Indonesian users
- Backward compatible with existing settings and preferences
